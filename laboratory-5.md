## 2. Which one would you like to try? Sign up to it

Take a look and check some differences between it and GitHub. Take screenshots to show them (at least two differences)

- ### I signed up to Gitlab: 


  ### Diferences:

  - I find it less intuitive at first sight, but everything seems to be explained step by step.
  
  - It's possible to select an avatar for the repository.
  
  - And it works with groups/subgroups, and then projects, not just repositories.
  
Create a public /private repository and create a document with the link and screenshots of the repository. Make sure to create a public repository I can access to it at less to read it.

## 3. Explain one thing you learn about GitHub you didnâ€™t know before reading the previous links

So, I didn't know that existed branch comparison views, I've been working with GitHub for some time now, and I wish I had known this feature existed before. 
Seems very useful to see if a forgotten branch has important changes not pull-requested, and see all changes at once, instead of viewing each commit ahead one by one, 
It's specially usefull if you do many small commits, in my opinion.
